Sometimes the best way to practice interacting with an API is to fiddle around with icanhazdadjoke.com

## about the API
icanhazdadjoke.com offers a free API for all your dad joke (and API learnin') needs: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api

## PSA
Be polite and set a User-Agent. It's nice when sites offer free APIs without a key for those of us who are learning. People like me appreciate when devs are respectful of the generosity of sites like this. :)
